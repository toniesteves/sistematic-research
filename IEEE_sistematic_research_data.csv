First, image-guided depth inference and upsampling is adopted and implemented to provide accurate depth maps while lowering the working frequency from 215MHz to 54MHz. Second, octave search range sampling is proposed to efficiently allocate depth labels for wide-depth-range scenes to save computation and maintain accuracy.

The PUF is tried to be implemented on an FPGA board and compared with similar FPGA board to catch the difference. In this case, the PUF is implemented on Cyclone IV, Intel FPGA board. The chosen FPGA are Cyclone IV EP4CE115F29 as FPGA 1, and Cyclone IV EP4CE10E22C8N as FPGA 2. The type of PUF used is Ring Oscillator (R-O) PUF. The result is shown, for testing the occurrence probability of a value 1 or P(bi=1) for each bit on two FPGA boards. In FPGA 1, the largest value of P(bi=1) is found at the first bit and the smallest value of P(bi=1) is at the fourth bit. For FPGA 2, the largest value of P(bi=1) is at the 13th bit, and the smallest value of P(bi=1) is at the 12th bit. For the average stability value at any position expressed by the Si parameter, the largest Si value on FPGA 1 is at the 4th-bit position and the smallest is at the 11th bit. For FPGA 2, the largest Si value is on the 12th bit while the smallest one is at position 11. In this work, the Hamming distance (HD) of the ROPUF output of both FPGA 1 and 2 are analyzed. For the two FPGA's, the Intra HD results are found to be unsatisfactory because there are still many changes in bit value (bit-flip) are within 1 - 2 bits. On the other hand, the Inter HD values obtained appear to be adequate with the average bit-flip in the range of 3-4 bits.

Lately proposed gradient domain guided image filter (GDGIF) is one of the typical works focusing on improving the quality of the filtering result of the original GIF, dealing with the halo-artifacts problem for edge-preserving smoothing. However, due to the involvement of global pixel values in the computation, high computation complexity and additional complex operation, there is no existing VLSI design for the gradient guided filter. This paper presents a high throughput VLSI architecture for real-time Full-HD (1920 &#x00D7; 1080) GDGIF. Four techniques are used in the newly proposed design to reduce the computation complexity and increase the processing throughput. First, a pre-processing stage is introduced to address the problem of global parameters required in the GDGIF. Second, multi-scale down-samplings are adopted for reducing circuit size and processing time. Then, a parallel structure operated at a higher frequency is used at the output stage to restore the full image size and to achieve high throughput at the same time. Last, approximated computation is introduced to eliminate speed bottleneck by simplifying the complex exponentiation operation. Based on the STM 65 nm CMOS technology, the implementation results show that the proposed architecture is able to support Full-HD image filtering at a throughput above 75 frame/second, with a design area of 586314 &#x03BC;m2 and power consumption of 18.5mW.",1051-8215;1558-2205,,10.1109/TCSVT.2018.2852336,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8401895,guided image filter;image/video processing;halo-artifacts;approximated computation,Image edge detection;Throughput;Very large scale integration;Computer architecture;Real-time systems;Smoothing methods;Cost function,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Early Access Articles

The effect is achieved by capturing a video at a higher frame rate and playing it back at a lower frame rate. While the still-image resolution of smartphone cameras ranges from 8MP to 25MP, standard videos are limited to 3 formats: 3840√ó2160 (4K2K, 2160p), 1920√ó1080 (Full High Definition, FHD, 1080p), and 1280√ó720 (High Definition, HD, 720p).

The single-slope (SS) ADC is an attractive choice for a balanced performance among high speed, low noise, small area, and low power consumption. However, in conventional SS ADC design, each ADC is hardwired to a column signal line. ADCs for skipped columns are left idle during the subsampling operation, and the potential to reach higher frame rate is not optimized.

In this paper, we present a field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based design and implementation of a multifunction ESC device that can detect radar pulses and can also differentiate them from SU signals in microsecond time scales. The proposed ESC device performs the following tasks in parallel: 1) it detects and differentiates between radar and SU signals; 2) it measures received signal strength from SUs for radar protection; and 3) it also measures SUs' airtime utilization (ATU) in a channel, which can be used to perform load balancing (based on ATU) of SUs on different channels for efficient access.

The superior signal quality of a point-to-point short-reach wireless system, allows the utilization of wideband communications to achieve a high throughput. Besides, in such wireless systems, the impacts of phase noise and nonlinear distortions are largely reduced, easing the SI cancellation. Moreover, the degradation of signal reception quality due to FD operation is experimentally evaluated in different environments. Experimental results of a prototype implementation show that a combination of antenna isolation and digital cancellation can already achieve an overall SI cancellation performance of 72.5 dB over a bandwidth of 123 MHz.

Reliable and Modeling Attack Resistant Authentication of Arbiter PUF in FPGA Implementation With Trinary Quadruple Response,S. S. Zalivaka; A. A. Ivaniuk; C. Chang,"School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore; Faculty of Computer Systems and Networks, Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics, Minsk, Belarus; School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore",IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,,2019,14,4,1109,1123,"Field programmable gate array (FPGA) is a potential hotbed for malicious and counterfeit hardware infiltration. Arbiter-based physical unclonable function (A-PUF) has been widely regarded as a suitable lightweight security primitive for FPGA bitstream encryption and device authentication. Unfortunately, the metastability of flip-flop gives rise to poor A-PUF reliability in FPGA implementation. Its linear additive path delays are also vulnerable to modeling attacks. Most reliability enhancement techniques tend to increase the response predictability and ease machine learning attacks. This paper presents a robust device authentication method based on the FPGA implementation of a reliability enhanced A-PUF with trinary digit (trit) quadruple responses. A two flip-flop arbiter is used to produce a trit for metastability detection. By considering the ordered responses to all four combinations of first and last challenge bits, each quadruple response can be compressed into a quadbit that represents one of the five classes of trit quadruple response with greater reproducibility. This challenge-response quadruple classification not only greatly reduces the burden of error correction at the device but also enables a precise A-PUF model to be built at the server without having to store the complete challenge-response pair (CRP) set for authentication. Besides, the real challenge to the A-PUF is generated internally by a lossy, nonlinear, and irreversible maximum length signature generator at both the server and device sides to prevent the naked CRP from being machine learned by the attacker. The A-PUF with short repetition code of length five has been tested to achieve a reliability of 1.0 over the full operating temperature range of the target FPGA board with lower hardware resource utilization than other modeling attack resilient strong PUFs. The proposed authentication protocol has also been experimentally evaluated to be practically secure against various machine learning attacks including evolutionary strategy covariance matrix adaptation.",1556-6013;1556-6021,,10.1109/TIFS.2018.2870835,Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund (AcRF) Tier II; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8466897,Arbiter PUF;reliability enhancement;machine learning attack resistance;authentication protocol,Field programmable gate arrays;Reliability;Authentication;Hardware;Servers;Machine learning;Resistance,circuit reliability;cryptographic protocols;cryptography;field programmable gate arrays;flip-flops;learning (artificial intelligence),reliability enhancement techniques;response predictability;robust device authentication method;FPGA implementation;trinary digit quadruple responses;flip-flop arbiter;trit quadruple response;challenge-response quadruple classification;A-PUF model;lossy length signature generator;irreversible maximum length signature generator;authentication protocol;arbiter PUF;trinary quadruple response;field programmable gate array;malicious hardware infiltration;counterfeit hardware infiltration;arbiter-based physical unclonable function;FPGA bitstream encryption;A-PUF reliability;linear additive path delays;machine learning attacks;FPGA board;attack resistant authentication;reliability enhanced A-PUF;complete challenge-response pair set;nonlinear length signature generator,,,60,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines

To bridge the gap between fast DNN construction in software (e.g., Caffe, TensorFlow) and slow hardware implementation, we propose DNNBuilder for building high-performance DNN hardware accelerators on FPGAs automatically. Novel techniques are developed to meet the throughput and latency requirements for both cloud- and edge-devices. A number of novel techniques including high-quality RTL neural network components, a fine-grained layer-based pipeline architecture, and a column-based cache scheme are developed to boost throughput, reduce latency, and save FPGA on-chip memory. To address the limited resource challenge, we design an automatic design space exploration tool to generate optimized parallelism guidelines by considering external memory access bandwidth, data reuse behaviors, FPGA resource availability, and DNN complexity. DNNBuilder is demonstrated on four DNNs (Alexnet, ZF, VGG16, and YOLO) on two FPGAs (XC7Z045 and KU115) corresponding to the edge- and cloud-computing, respectively. The fine-grained layer-based pipeline architecture and the column-based cache scheme contribute to 7.7x and 43x reduction of the latency and BRAM utilization compared to conventional designs. We achieve the best performance (up to 5.15x faster) and efficiency (up to 5.88x more efficient) compared to published FPGA-based classification-oriented DNN accelerators for both edge and cloud computing cases. We reach 4218 GOPS for running object detection DNN which is the highest throughput reported to the best of our knowledge.

Thus, modern robots require improved vision systems capable of obtaining information about such environments at a high acquisition rate and with high processing speeds. The growing demand for robotic platforms, both industrial and mobile, has greatly boosted the development of advanced vision systems. A weak point of traditional computer vision is that it depends on algorithms executed on a computer or server connected to the robot, often involving the need for high computing resources. Therefore, much of the efforts of the last decades have been focused on the improvement of those algorithms. Nevertheless, when the limit of traditional software processing systems (PCs, microcontrollers and microprocessors) is reached, it is necessary to migrate to a more versatile platform -which generally leads to hardware solutions-. The HW/SW design is possible because of high-frequency bridges between the Hard-Processor System (HPS) and the FPGA.

As an example, in this paper, we present the design and performance evaluation of the photonics-based Terahertz wireless communication system for the transmission of uncompressed 4K video feed that is built using all commercially available system components. In particular, two independent tunable lasers operating in the infrared C-band are used as a source for generating the Terahertz carrier wave using frequency difference generation in a photomixer. One of the IR laser beams carries the data which is intensity modulated using the LiNbO<sub>3</sub>electro-optic modulator. A zero bias Schottky diode is used as the detector and demodulator of the data stream followed by the high-gain and low-noise pre-amplifier.

Nevertheless, how to efficiently design high accuracy large-disparity stereo matching on FPGA is still a grand challenge. The computational complexity of previously proposed stereo matching is inevitably proportional to disparity range, hence their hardware designs become very inefficient when the disparity range is large. Motivated by the original PatchMatch and weighted median filtering algorithms, this paper proposes a NIPM-sWMF algorithm to significantly reduce the computational complexity of stereo matching and make it independent of disparity range. Moreover, we also propose a fully pipelined architecture design on FPGA that employs several hardware techniques to efficiently implement the proposed NIPM-sWMF.

Although CNN-based SR methods have shown very promising results for SR, their computational complexities are prohibitive for hardware implementation. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to implement a real-time CNN-based SR HW that upscales 2K full high-definition (FHD) video to 4K ultra high-definition (UHD) video at 60 frames per second (fps). In our dedicated CNN-based SR HW, low resolution (LR) input frames are processed line-by-line, and the number of convolutional filter parameters is reduced significantly by incorporating depth-wise separable convolutions with a residual connection. Our CNN-based SR HW incorporates a cascade of 1D convolutions having large receptive fields along horizontal lines while keeping vertical receptive fields minimal, which allows to save required line memory space in achieving comparable SR performance against full 2D convolution operations. For efficient HW implementation, we use a simple and effective quantization method with little peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) degradation. Also, we propose a compression method to efficiently store intermediate feature map data to reduce the number of line memories used in HW.

In HEVC, the complexity of ME further increases due to a large processing unit and flexible partitioning of the prediction unit (PU). In this paper, we proposed a low power ME algorithm and architecture of the HEVC for consumer applications. The proposed algorithm and architecture utilizes sub-sampling, data reuse, pixel truncation and adaptive search range techniques for reducing the computational power. Simulations result shows that the proposed ME algorithm requires an average of 53.82% fewer search points as compared to the reference software HM with a small degradation in PSNR and little increment in bit-rate. The proposed architecture is simulated and synthesized using standard 90 nm technology. The proposed ME architecture can process 3840 √ó 2160 @ 30 fps video sequences with only 4.5193 mm<sup>2</sup>of the area and 8.192 KB of SRAM. The operating frequency of the proposed architecture is 250 MHz with 151.7619 mW of power.",0098-3063;1558-4127,,10.1109/TCE.2018.2867823,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8450036,CTU;HEVC;motion estimation;motion vector;PU;SAD,Computer architecture;Video coding;Prediction algorithms;Standards;Transforms;Encoding;Videos,data compression;high definition video;image sequences;motion estimation;power aware computing;video codecs;video coding,low power motion estimation algorithm;consumer applications;high-quality videos;HD video data;video compression standard;high efficient video coding;video CODEC;low power ME algorithm;data reuse;adaptive search range techniques;ME architecture;HEVC/H.265;video sequences;visual information data;two-fold video efficiency improvements;frequency 250.0 MHz;power 151.7619 mW;memory size 8.192 KByte;size 90.0 nm,,,29,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines

Applications requiring high security commonly generate keys based on physical unclonable functions (PUFs), circuits that use random manufacturing variations to produce secret keys that are unique to each device. Implementing PUFs on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) is usually difficult, because the designer has limited control over layout, and each PUF system requires a large area overhead to correct errors in the PUF response bits. In this paper, we extend the state of the art for FPGA-based weak PUFs using a novel methodology of per-device configuration and a new PUF variant derived from the popular FPGA-specific Anderson PUF. The PUF is evaluated using Xilinx XC7Z020 programmable systemon-chips from the Virtex-7 family on Zynq ZedBoard platforms. The design we propose has several advantages over existing work including the Anderson PUF on which it is based. Our design is tunable to minimize the response bias and can be implemented using the common SLICEL components on Xilinx FPGAs. Moreover, the proposed PUF design enables an efficient per-device configuration that reduces bit error rate by over 10√ó at room temperature and improves response stability by over 2√ó across all temperatures. We demonstrate that the proposed per-device PUF configuration step leads to roughly 2√ó savings in area resources for PUFs and error correction as used in key generation.",1063-8210;1557-9999,,10.1109/TVLSI.2018.2877438,National Science Foundation; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8533400,Design methodology;field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs);physical unclonable function (PUF),Field programmable gate arrays;Multiplexing;Delays;Random access memory;Encryption,copy protection;error statistics;field programmable gate arrays;integrated circuit layout;private key cryptography;system-on-chip,response stability;Zynq ZedBoard platforms;SLICEL components;PUF-based key generation;FPGA-specific Anderson PUF;Xilinx XC7Z020 programmable system-on-chips;Xilinx FPGA;error correction;per-device PUF configuration step;bit error rate;PUF design;Virtex-7 family;PUF response bits;PUF system;field-programmable gate arrays;secret keys;reconfigurable systems,,,39,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines

Owing to the dense packing and close proximity of the electrodes in such systems, a stimulation through one electrode can cause large electrical artifacts on neighboring electrodes that easily saturate the corresponding recording amplifiers. To suppress such artifacts, the high-pass corner frequencies of all available 2048 recording channels can be raised from several Hz to several kHz by applying a ""soft-reset"" or pole-shifting technique. With the implemented artifact suppression technique, the saturation time of the recording circuits, connected to electrodes in immediate vicinity to the stimulation site, could be reduced to less than 150Œºs. For the stimulation buffer, we developed a circuit, which can operate in two modes: either control of only the stimulation voltage, or control of current and voltage during stimulation.

In this paper it is proposed the use of the Notification Oriented Paradigm (NOP) for Digital Hardware as a high-level synthesis tool. The NOP is a development technique that presents a new concept for designing and executing applications, based on rules and collaborative entities, which communicate through notifications in a parallel way. In order to allow the use of the NOP in the creation of digital hardware as a new high-level synthesis tool, a new programming language was proposed, and both a compiler and an emulator where implemented. With these tools it is possible to generate VHDL code directly from a high level NOP program.

HELP analyzes variations in path delays that occur within a hardware-implemented macro. Two novel techniques are proposed in which the verifier computes a set of offsets that are used to fine tune the token's digitized path delays as a means of maximizing entropy and reproducibility in the generated bitstrings. The offsets are derived from the enrollment data stored by the server in a secure database. A population-based offset method is proposed, which computes median values using data from multiple tokens. A second chip-specific technique is proposed, which fine tunes path delays using the stored enrollment data associated with the authenticating token.

Due to the intrinsic and lightweight nature of a PUF, they have been proposed to provide security at a low cost for many applications, in particular for the internet of things (IoT). Many metrics have been proposed to evaluate the security and performance of PUF architectures, two of which are uniqueness and min-entropy. The uniqueness of a PUF response evaluates its ability to differentiate between different physical devices, while the min-entropy estimation is a measure of how much uncertainty the PUF response contains. The min-entropy is a lower-bound of real entropy. When the uniqueness of a PUF design is close to the optimal, it is unclear if this also implies that the design has a significantly high entropy; hence it would be useful to ascertain the minimum uniqueness required to achieve a given entropy. To date, a thorough investigation of the relationship between uniqueness and entropy for PUF designs has not been conducted. In this paper, this relationship between the uniqueness and entropy is explored, and for the first time, to the authors' knowledge, the relationship between them is modeled. To verify this model, both simulated and hardware-based experimental results are performed, with a test-bed containing 184 Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA based Basys3 boards providing a large data set for granular results.

The basic idea is to pass the same input signal to two scannable flip-flops and to use the discrepancy in the two output signals' arrival time to generate a PUF bit. Symmetrical SR-latches are used as arbiters to reduce PUF design cost.

Attackers can utilize CRAs to hijack the control flow of programs to perform malicious actions without injecting any codes. Many defenses, classed into software-based and hardware-based, have been proposed. However, software-based methods are difficult to be deployed in practical systems due to high performance overhead. Hardware-based methods can reduce performance overhead but may require extending instruction set architectures (ISAs) and modifying the compiler or suffer the vulnerability of key leakage. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a new hardware-assisted control flow checking method to resist CRAs with negligible performance overhead without extending ISAs, modifying the compiler or leaking the encryption/decryption key. The key technique involves two control flow checking mechanisms. The first one is the encrypted Hamming distances matching between the physical unclonable function (PUF) response and the return addresses, which prevents attackers from returning between gadgets so long as the PUF response is secret, thus resisting ROP attacks. The second one is the linear encryption/decryption operation (XOR) between the PUF response and the instructions at target addresses of call and jmp instructions to defeat JOP attacks. Advanced return-based full-function reuse attacks will be prevented with the dynamic key-updating method. Experimental evaluations on benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method introduces negligible 0.95% runtime overhead and 0.78% binary size overhead on average.",2327-4662;2372-2541,,10.1109/JIOT.2018.2866164,National Natural Science Foundation of China; Natural Science Foundation of¬†Hunan Province; Hu-Xiang Youth Talent Program; 2017 CCF-IFAA Research Fund; Science and Technology Key Projects of Hunan Province; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8440029,Code reuse attacks (CRAs);control flow integrity (CFI);hardware-assisted security;physical unclonable function (PUF),Runtime;Cryptography;Internet of Things;Malware;Programming;Resists,cryptography;instruction sets;program compilers,hardware-assisted control-flow integrity;code reuse attacks;return-oriented programming;jump-oriented programming;ingenious security threats;malicious actions;software-based methods;practical systems;high performance overhead;hardware-based methods;extending instruction;compiler;key leakage;hardware-assisted control flow;negligible performance overhead;key technique;encrypted Hamming distances;physical unclonable function response;return addresses;PUF response;ROP attacks;linear encryption/decryption operation;jmp instructions;JOP attacks;advanced return-based full-function reuse attacks;CRA;ISA;encryption-decryption key,,3,56,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines

OpenVDAP: An Open Vehicular Data Analytics Platform for CAVs,Q. Zhang; Y. Wang; X. Zhang; L. Liu; X. Wu; W. Shi; H. Zhong,NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,2018 IEEE 38th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS),,2018,,,1310,1320,"In this paper, we envision the future connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) as a sophisticated computer on wheels, with substantial on-board sensors as data sources and a variety of services running on top to support autonomous driving or other functions. In general, these services are computationally expensive, especially for the machine learning based applications (e.g., CNN-based object detection). Nevertheless, the on-board computation unit possess limited compute resources, raising a huge challenge to deploy these computation-intensive services on the vehicle. On the contrary, the cloud-based architecture conceptually with unconstrained resources suffers from unexpected extended latency that attributes to the large-scale Internet data transmission; thus, adversely affecting the services' real-time performance, quality of services and user experiences. To address this dilemma, inspired by the promising edge computing paradigm, we propose to build an Open Vehicular Data Analytics Platform (OpenVDAP) for CAVs, which is a full-stack edge based platform including an on-board computing/communication unit, an isolation-supported and security & privacy-preserved vehicle operation system, an edge-aware application library, as well as an optimal workload of?oading and scheduling strategy, allowing CAVs to dynamically detect each service's status, computation overhead and the optimal of?oading destination so that each service could be finished within an acceptable latency and limited bandwidth consumption. Most importantly, contrast to the proprietary platform, OpenVDAP is an open-source platform that offers free APIs and real-?eld vehicle data to the researchers and developers in the community, allowing them to deploy and evaluate applications on the real environment.",2575-8411,978-1-5386-6871-9978-1-5386-6872,10.1109/ICDCS.2018.00131,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8416394,edge computing;vehicular data analysis;vehicular operating system;security & privacy;connected and autonomous vehicles,Autonomous vehicles;Real-time systems;Data analysis;Machine learning;Cloud computing;Security,application program interfaces;cloud computing;data analysis;data privacy;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing,autonomous vehicles;CAVs;on-board sensors;data sources;autonomous driving;CNN-based object detection;on-board computation unit;computation-intensive services;cloud-based architecture;unconstrained resources;unexpected extended latency;large-scale Internet data transmission;open vehicular data analytics platform;OpenVDAP;full-stack edge based platform;on-board computing/communication unit;security & privacy-preserved vehicle operation system;edge-aware application library;computation overhead;proprietary platform;open-source platform;edge computing paradigm;quality of services;user experiences,,2,47,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Firstly, a hardware architecture sharing line-by-line overlapped convolution kernels is proposed to reduce the number of arithmetic operations in demosaicing of bayer RGB images without image quality degradation. Secondly, an adaptive sync compensation module is proposed to synchronize master/slave image sensors, and display devices by compensating the sync signals period of slave image sensor and display devices in real-time, after monitoring varying periods of the master sync signals.

In this paper, we comprehensively analyze the side-channel power leakage of various XTS-AES implementations and invent effective attacks. We first run a simple power analysis of a software implementation. For a hardware implementation on FPGA, we analyze side-channel leakage of the particular modular multiplication in XTS-AES mode.

Our system produces dense motion fields in real time at high resolutions. We implemented a new version of the Ridge Regression Optical flow algorithm. This architecture design focuses on maximizing parallel operations of large amounts of pixel data and pipelining the data flow to allow for real time throughput. A specialized memory controller unit was designed to access pixel data from seven different frames. This memory control alleviates any memory bottleneck. The new architecture can process 1080p HD video streams at over 60 frames per second. This design requires no processor nor data bus which allows it to be more easily manufactured as an ASIC.,2473-3598,978-1-5386-6568-8978-1-5386-6567-1978-1-5386-6569,10.1109/SSIAI.2018.8470370,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8470370,optical flow;hardware design,Hardware;Field programmable gate arrays;Table lookup;Random access memory;Adaptive optics;Smoothing methods;Real-time systems,application specific integrated circuits;high definition video;image sequences;motion estimation;video streaming,video streams;real time video streams;real time throughput;ASIC;dense motion fields;new hardware architecture;specialized memory controller unit;data flow;pixel data;architecture design;Ridge Regression Optical flow algorithm,,,10,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Although the increasing data rates of in-vehicle networks allow the integration of more demanding (e.g., camera-based) applications, processing speeds and, in particular, memory bandwidths are no longer scaling accordingly. The need for authentication, on the other hand, stems from the ongoing convergence of traditionally separated functional domains and the extended connectivity both in- (e.g., smart-phones) and outside (e.g., telemetry, cloud-based services and vehicle-to-X technologies) current vehicles. The inclusion of cryptographic measures thus requires careful interface design to meet throughput, latency, safety, security and power constraints given by the particular application domain. Over the last decades, this has forced system designers to not only optimize their software stacks accordingly, but also incrementally move interface functionalities from software to hardware.

An additional challenge is the growing number of counterfeit components in these devices, with serious reliability and financial repercussions. Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) are a promising security primitive to help address these concerns. Memory-based PUFs are particularly attractive as they can be realized with minimal or no additional hardware beyond what is already present in all embedded systems, i.e., memory. However, current memory-based PUFs utilize only a single memory technology for constructing the PUF, which has many disadvantages including making them vulnerable to certain security attacks. Several of these PUFs also suffer from other shortcomings such as low entropy, limited number of challenge-response pairs, etc. In this paper, we propose the design of a new memory-based combination PUF that tightly integrates (two) heterogeneous memory technologies to address these challenges/shortcomings. Our design enables us to authenticate an on-chip component and an off-chip component, thereby taking a step towards multi-component authentication in a device, without incorporating any additional hardware. We have implemented a prototype of the proposed combination PUF using a Terasic TR4-230 FPGA development board and several off-the-shelf SRAMs and DRAMs. Measured experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements over current memory-based PUFs including the ability to resist various security attacks. We also propose a lightweight authentication scheme that ensures robust operation of the PUF across environmental and temporal variations. Extensive authentication tests performed on several PUF prototypes achieved a true-positive rate of greater than 97.5 percent across these variations. The absence of any false-positives, even under an invasive attack, further highlighted the effectiveness of the overall design.",2332-7766;2372-207X,,10.1109/TMSCS.2018.2885758,National Science Foundation; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8568007,Physically unclonable function;authentication;hardware security;dynamic random access memory;static random access memory;PUF,Random access memory;Authentication;Hardware;Security;Embedded systems,,,,,42,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines

It is especially suitable for resource constrained security applications, e.g. internet of things (IoT) devices. The ring oscillator (RO) PUF and the static RAM (SRAM) PUF are two of the most extensively studied PUF designs. However, previous RO PUF designs require a lot of hardware resources for ROs to be robust and SRAM PUFs are not suitable for authentication. The previous research by the author proposed a tristate static RAM (TSRAM) PUF which is a highly flexible challenge response pair (CRP) based SRAM PUF design. In this paper, a novel configurable PUF structure based on tristate inverters, namely a tristate configurable ring oscillator (TCRO) PUF is proposed. A configurable delay unit, composed of a tristate matrix, is used to replace the inverters in the RO PUF. The configurable bits are able to select a subset of the tristate inverters in the delay unit. Each tristate inverter is completely utilized by using the configurable delay unit and thus the approach enhances the flexibility and entropy of the proposed PUF design. The proposed PUF design can generate an exponential number of CRPs compared with the conventional RO PUF. Moreover, the proposed design significantly reduces the hardware resource consumption of the RO PUF. Delay models of both the TSRAM PUF and the proposed TCRO PUF designs are presented.

To store the growing volume of surveillance videos, video compression is beneficial for reducing video volume; however, it is simultaneously harmful to the video quality. Video quality assessment (VQA) methods help to achieve a tradeoff between the data volume and perceptual quality of compressed surveillance videos. Generally speaking, surveillance video quality assessment (SVQA) is different from conventional VQA because surveillance videos are usually used for specific tasks, e.g., pedestrian recognition, rather than for entertainment purposes. Therefore, in this work, we propose two full-reference SVQA methods based on the concept of Quality of Recognition (QoR). We first design two new tasks, distorted face verification (DFV) and distorted face identification (DFI), based on which we further propose two SVQA methods, DFV-SVQA and DFI-SVQA, and corresponding quality metrics. The core components of the DFVSVQA and DFI-SVQA methods are feature extractors (a DFV model and a DFI model), which we construct using convolutionalneural- network-based face recognition models. In addition, we construct a real-world surveillance video dataset, based on which we analyze how various factors, including the video codec, compression level, face resolution and light intensity, affect the quality of compressed surveillance videos.

The communication protocols/standards including MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) are enforcing additional cares in device-to-system design perspectives. Due to computation-capacity limitations (CCLs) in battery-operated IoTD, heavy-duty crypto-algorithms are prohibited. This results in compromised hardware using lightweight algorithms. In this study, a new implementation schema for hierarchically-connected IoTD for indoor applications is proposed. This schema allows the IoT network to utilise strong-crypto-algorithms (i.e. RSA) instead of lightweight algorithms (i.e. attribute-based encryption (ABE)). Therefore, without increasing the consumption power or complexity, the security in the IoT network increases. This method brings about a new low CCL RSA with two-folded power-aware implementation. Furthermore, without complexity overhead, the proposed method is more secure than the conventional implementation due to the inherent countermeasure against the side-channel attacks. The presented schema is implemented on a target IoT network, utilising in XC7A100T-FPGA as IoT nodes. Furthermore, both the conventional and the proposed RSA-2048 have been implemented in Spartan6-LX75 on a SAKURA-GW board.

In this paper, we propose a flexible processor-in-memory (PIM) solution for scalable and energy-efficient execution of deep convolutional networks (ConvNets), one of the fastest-growing workloads for servers and high-end embedded systems. Our co-design approach consists of a network of Smart Memory Cubes (modular extensions to the standard HMC) each augmented with a many-core PIM platform called NeuroCluster. NeuroClusters have a modular design based on NeuroStream coprocessors (for Convolution-intensive computations) and general-purpose RISC-V cores. In addition, a DRAM-friendly tiling mechanism and a scalable computation paradigm are presented to efficiently harness this computational capability with a very low programming effort. NeuroCluster occupies only 8 percent of the total logic-base (LoB) die area in a standard HMC and achieves an average performance of 240 GFLOPS for complete execution of full-featured state-of-the-art (SoA) ConvNets within a power budget of 2.5 W. Overall 11 W is consumed in a single SMC device, with 22.5 GFLOPS/W energy-efficiency which is 3.5X better than the best GPU implementations in similar technologies.

To support efficient scheduling on HPC systems it is necessary to perform accurate performance predictions for OpenCL workloads on varied compute devices, which is challenging due to diverse computation, communication and memory access characteristics which result in varying performance between devices. The Architecture Independent Workload Characterization (AIWC) tool can be used to characterize OpenCL kernels according to a set of architecture-independent features. This work presents a methodology where AIWC features are used to form a model capable of predicting accelerator execution times. We used this methodology to predict execution times for a set of 37 computational kernels running on 15 different devices representing a broad range of CPU, GPU and MIC architectures. The predictions are highly accurate, differing from the measured experimental run-times by an average of only 1.2%, and correspond to actual execution time mispredictions of 9 ps to 1 sec according to problem size. A previously unencountered code can be instrumented once and the AIWC metrics embedded in the kernel, to allow performance prediction across the full range of modelled devices.

Existing state-of-the-art digital circuit PUFs, however, are either hybrid of analog-digital circuits which are still under the shadow of vulnerability, or impractical for real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel highly nonlinear and secure digital PUF (D-PUF) and the spliced version SD-PUF. The fingerprints are extracted from intentionally induced very large-scale integration interconnect randomness during lithography process, as well as a post-silicon shuffling process. Strongly skewed CMOS latches are used to ensure the immunity against environmental and operational variations. Crucially, a highly nonlinear logic network is proposed to effectively spread and augment any subtle interconnect randomness, which also enables strong resilience against machine learning attacks. On top of it, the expandable architecture of the proposed logic network empowers a novel post-silicon shuffle-splice mechanism, where multiple randomly selected D-PUFs are spliced to be one SD-PUF, pushing the statistical security to a much higher level, while significantly reducing the mask cost per PUF device. It also decouples the trustworthy demands enforced to the foundries or other third party manufacturers. Our proposed PUFs demonstrate close to ideal performance in terms of statistical metrics, including 0 intra-Hamming distance. Various state-of-the-art machine learning models show prediction accuracies almost no better than random guesses when attacking to the proposed PUFs. We also mathematically prove the probability of existence of identical SD-PUF pair is significantly lower than that of D-PUF pair, e.g., such probability of an SD-PUF spliced by 30 D-PUFs is 2.3 √ó 10<sup>-22</sup>, which is 19 order magnitude lower than that of D-PUF.

In addition, randomization and DD are utilized for both time-domain hiding of information leakage during the active region (dynamic currents) and for amplitude-domain hiding of information leakage during the static-region (leakage currents).

Breaking High Resolution CNN Bandwidth Barriers with Enhanced Depth-First Execution,K. Goetschalckx; M. Verhelst,MICAS - ESAT - KU Leuven.; MICAS - ESAT - KU Leuven.,IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems,,2019,PP,99,1,1,"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) now also start to reach impressive performance on non-classification image processing tasks, such as denoising, demosaicing, super resolution and super slow motion. Consequently, CNNs are increasingly deployed on very high resolution images. However, the resulting high resolution feature maps pose unseen requirements on the memory system of neural network processing systems, as on-chip memories are too small to store high resolution feature maps, while off-chip memories are very costly in terms of I/O bandwidth and power. This paper first shows that the classical layer-by-layer inference approaches are bounded in their external I/O bandwidth vs. on-chip memory trade-off space, making it infeasible to scale up to very high resolutions at a reasonable cost. Next, we demonstrate how an alternative depth-first network computation can reduce I/O bandwidth requirements up to >200√ó for a fixed on-chip memory size or, alternatively, reduce on-chip memory requirements up to >10000√ó for a fixed I/O bandwidth limitation.

There are four main features in our proposed AMP-MP. First, we employ the matrix multiplication in GF(28) computation to transform the 16 plaintexts into one plaintext, hence improving the authentication speed by 32√ó collectively at the transmitter and receiver. Second, we reschedule the operations of three AES encryptions in three different cores such that their physical leakages are compensated and equalized, thus reducing the correlation of physical leakage with the processed data by >3√ó. Third, the intermediate values of AES-CCM are propagated asynchronously between different cores to randomize the physical leakages with the processed data, and therefore further enhance the security of AES-CCM against the SCA by another 3√ó. Fourth, we propose a key adjusting technique based on S-Box byte-key transformation to protect the key against pattern-based attack. Our proposed AMP-MP is realized on an 8-bit asynchronous 9-core processor fabricated based on the 65 nm CMOS process.

RCA stores high frequency patterns and performs computation inside CAM without using processing cores. During execution time, RCA searches an input operand among all prestored values on a CAM and returns the row with the nearest distance. To manage accuracy, we use a distance metric which considers the impact of each bit indices on computation accuracy.

Eight NVIDIA Jetson TX1 and three Jetson TX2 GPUs are used to construct a streaming embedded cloud platform (SECP), on which Apache Storm is deployed as the cloud computing environment for deep learning algorithms (Convolutional Neural Networks - CNNs) to process video streams. Additionally, self-managing services are designed to ensure that this platform can run smoothly and stably, in the form of a metric sensor, a bottleneck detector and a scheduler. This platform is evaluated in terms of processing speed, power consumption, and network throughput by running various deep learning algorithms for object detection. The results show the proposed platform can run deep learning algorithms on embedded devices while meeting the high scalability and fault tolerance required for real-time video processing.",2168-7161;2372-0018,,10.1109/TCC.2019.2894621,National Natural Science Foundation of China; Key Research Program of Shandong Province; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8624373,embedded devices;low power consumption;deep learning;video processing;convolutional neural networks,Streaming media;Cloud computing;Real-time systems;Deep learning;Storms;Fasteners;Object detection,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Early Access Articles

EE-SPFAL: A Novel Energy-Efficient Secure Positive Feedback Adiabatic Logic for DPA Resistant RFID and Smart Card,S. Dinesh Kumar; H. Thapliyal; A.

Adiabatic logic is one of the circuit design techniques that can be used to design energy-efficient and secure hardware. However, the existing DPA resistant adiabatic logic families suffer from non-adiabatic energy loss. Therefore, this work presents a novel adiabatic logic family called Energy-Efficient Secure Positive Feedback Adiabatic Logic (EE-SPFAL) family that reduces the non-adiabatic energy loss and also is secure against DPA attacks. The proposed EESPFAL is used to design logic gates such as buffers, XOR, and NAND. Further, the logic gates based on EE-SPFAL are used to implement a Positive Polarity Reed Muller (PPRM) architecture based S-box circuit. SPICE simulations at 12.5 MHz show that EE-SPFAL based S-box circuit saves up to 65% of energy and 90% of energy per cycle as compared to the S-box circuit implemented using existing Secured Quasi-Adiabatic Logic (SQAL) and conventional CMOS logic, respectively. Further, the security of EE-SPFAL based S-box circuit has been evaluated by performing the DPA attack through SPICE simulations. We proved that the EE-SPFAL based S-box circuit is resistant to a DPA attack through a developed DPA attack flow applicable to SPICE simulations. Further, we have implemented the round 0 and round 1 of Advanced Standard Encryption (AES) algorithm.

Memory partitioning is an efficient method to overcome the impediment of memory bandwidth restricting the speed of parallel data access. However, when applied to previous memory partitioning methods, MLC STT-RAM is still facing challenges.

The method is based on the online estimation of the motor harmonic flux. For this purpose, a novel minimal parameter harmonic flux estimator (MPHFE) is developed. The MPHFE is formulated such that the inductance, resistance, and stator current and its derivative are not necessary for the estimation of the harmonic flux. This was achieved by forcing the harmonic current to zero through the combined action of a field-oriented controller (FOC) and a feedforward controller. Subsequently, the harmonic flux can be obtained directly from the estimated harmonic back EMF without the involvement of other motor parameters. Finally, the estimated flux is used in conjunction with a comprehensive model of the motor harmonic torque to determine the stator current compensation for eliminating the torque harmonic.

A Low Power Diode-Clamped Inverter-Based Strong Physical Unclonable Function for Robust and Lightweight Authentication,Y. Cao; C. Q. Liu; C. H. Chang,"College of Internet of Things Engineering, Hohai University, Changzhou, China; MediaTek Singapore Pte Ltd., Singapore; School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore",IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers,,2018,65,11,3864,3873,"Strong physical unclonable function (PUF) transcends the limitations of legacy secure key storage methods as emerging security primitive for cryptography and device identification/authentication. In this paper, a new low power and reliable mono-stable strong PUF is proposed. Its primary entropy is derived from the process variations of the parallel diode-clamped single inverter ring working in the subthreshold region. Due to manufacturing process variations, the monostable state of the output voltage of single inverter ring is Gaussian distributed around the half Vdd point. The spread of the Gaussian is broadened by mixing it with another Gaussian distributed trip point obtained from a diode-clamped parallel inverter stage. As the main entropy of the raw response bits is derived from a mono-stable circuit, it has greater immunity to perturbances introduced by operating environments. In addition, as the mono-stable state for the output voltage is a non-linear combination of individual inverter rings, the resilience against machine learning attacks can be improved. The prototype chip was fabricated using a commercial 40-nm CMOS technology. The measurement results show that the power consumption of the 64-bit mono-stable PUF is merely 3.85 ŒºW. The native bit error rate is <;8% at 0.9 ~ 1.3 V and -40~ 90¬∞C, which can be further reduced to <;1% using the proposed thresholding technique.

There are four key features in our proposed PRL. First, variance analysis on PLI is implemented to determine the boundary of the clusters and objects of the clusters. Second, the nearest-neighbor k-NN variance clustering is used to reduce the sampling points of PLI by clustering the high variance sampling points and discarding the low variance sampling points of PLI measurements (traces). These clustered sampling points, which are highly correlated with the processed data, contain pertinent leakage information related to the secret key. Third, the information associated with the secret key is spread in several neighboring sampling points with different degrees of leakages. We analytically derive the Key-leakage relevance factor for each clustered sampling point to quantify the degree of leakage associated with the secret key. Fourth, by means of Hebbian learning, a weight proportional to the Key-leakage relevance factor is updated iteratively based on the values of relevance factor and traces of the sampling points. The converged weights which are being assigned to clustered sampling points are linked to their associated PLI to further increase the correlation of the PLI with the processed data. Therefore, the required number of PLI measurements, to reveal the secret key, can be reduced significantly. In addition, we analytically show that the computational complexity of our proposed PRL is<formula><tex>$O(n)$</tex></formula>when compared to the reported profiling techniques having<formula><tex>$O(n^2)$</tex></formula>and<formula><tex>$O(n^3)$</tex></formula>computational complexities.

The robustness of our proposed PRL is examined with four different frequencies (embodying four noise levels), various reported profiling techniques and two hiding countermeasures applied on the PLI (vertical and horizontal hidings).

As other computer screens, cockpit screens consists in computer generated graphics often atop natural background. Existing screen content coding schemes fail notably in preserving the readability of textual information at the low bitrates required in avionic applications. We propose a screen coding scheme where textual information is encoded according to the relative semantics rather than in the pixel domain. The encoder localizes textual information, the semantics of each character are extracted with a convolutional neural network and are predictively encoded. Text is then removed via inpainting, the residual background video is compressed with a standard codec and transmitted to the receiver together with the text semantics. At the decoder side, text is synthesized from the encoded semantics and superimposed over the residual video recovering the original frame. Our proposed scheme offers two key advantages over a semantics-unaware scheme that encodes text in the pixel domain. First, the text readability at the decoder is not compromised by compression artifacts, whereas the relative bitrate is negligible. Second, removal of high-frequency transform coefficients associated to the inpainted text drastically reduces the bitrate of the residual video. Experiments with real cockpit video sequences show BDrate gains up to 82% and 69 % over a reference H.265/HEVC encoder and its SCC extension. Moreover, our scheme achieves quasi-errorless character recognition already at very low bitrates, whereas even HEVC-SCC needs at least 3 or 4 times more bit-rate to achieve a comparable error rate.",1520-9210;1941-0077,,10.1109/TMM.2019.2900168,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8643799,HEVC;screen content coding;cockpit content coding;low bitrate;character recognition;semantic video coding;convolutional neural networks;compound video;compound images,Image coding;Semantics;Encoding;Bit rate;Decoding;Compounds;Airplanes,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Early Access Articles

This paper presents LKSM, a light weight key-value storage system, which can be deployed on either one node or multiple nodes. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt to propose key-value store in this scenario. We carefully analyze the challenges when designing the system on mobile clusters, and further propose RDS for addressing. With the help of RDS, LKSM achieves the goal of lower latency, better scalability, and higher availability. Furthermore, based on RDS, a novel data management strategy is presented, which successfully avoid energy holes of mobile clusters and achieves the tradeoff between performance and energy. We organize LKSM using a log-structured merge-tree and implement it based on LevelDB, an open source key-value storage system proposed by Google. Experiments on physical smartphones demonstrate that LKSM presents much higher performance compared with the ported LevelDB on mobile devices.",1939-1374;2372-0204,,10.1109/TSC.2018.2852683,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8402150,Mobile computing;Distributed databases;Real-time distributed;Energy aware system,Performance evaluation;Smart phones;Flash memories;Scalability;Compaction;Indexing,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Early Access Articles

For coping with these challenges, this paper proposes methods for rectifying the polyview images, estimating depth of the scene, and synthesizing stereoscopic panoramas. The proposed camera is compact in size, light in weight, and inexpensive.

First, we present a flash memory error tolerance design strategy customized for video data storage, which can enable the use of lower-cost less-reliable flash memory chips for video storage. The cost challenge can also be addressed by reducing the video storage footprint through on-the-fly transcoding. However, direct transcoding suffers from a high implementation cost.

Approximate computing is a viable method to save energy and increase performance by controllably trading off energy for accuracy. In this paper, we propose a tiered approximate floating point multiplier, called CFPU, which significantly reduces energy consumption and improves the performance of multiplication at a slight cost in accuracy. The floating point multiplication is approximated by replacing the costly mantissa multiplication step of the operation with lower energy alternatives. We process the data by using one of the three modes: a basic approximate mode, an intermediate approximate mode, or on the exact hardware, depending on the accuracy requirements. We evaluate the efficiency of the proposed CFPU on a wide range of applications including twelve general OpenCL ones and three machine learning applications. Our results show that using the first CFPU approximation mode results in 3.5√ó energy-delay product (EDP) improvement, compared to a GPU using traditional FPUs, while ensuring less than 10% average relative error.

To facilitate higher data rates in future 5G communication, the demands for the wideband signals are continuously increasing, which creates adversity in employing digital predistortion (DPD) for the linearization of RF PA in ultra-wideband systems. System bandwidth constraint of the conventional DPD does not provide sufficient linearization of wideband signals. In this paper, we present two types of predistorter, first is RFin-RFout analog predistorter, in which linearization is performed by RF components in the analog domain, and the second is hybrid RF predistorter which takes the advantage of advanced DSP platform for improving the performance of RFin-RFout analog predistorter. The proposed predistorters eliminate the constraint on the system bandwidth of the conventional DPD. The requirements of data converters and reconstruction filters are relaxed in the analog predistorter (APD) architecture, whereas hybrid digitally controlled (HDC) APD eliminates the need of analog components by compensating the delay digitally.

For sampled N recent pixels, we eliminate those outlier pixels which have insufficient neighbors within a given distance threshold value. For background updating, we uniformly mix reference pixels (non-outliers) and old background pixel. We calculate Manhattan distance of inter-pixels in RGB color space for fast speed. Moreover, we are inspired by the fact that moving objects (including swaying ones) should not be used for background updating during each single pixel modeling process of whole background. Thus, we present an enhancement technique by ignoring motion pixels contribution to background modeling. Pixel block's motion vector is determined by block matching and the union of all moving pixel blocks is skipped for background updating.

However, DNNs are computationally expensive in both train and inference modes as they require the precision of floating point operations. Although, several prior work proposed approximate hardware to accelerate DNNs inference, they have not considered the impact of training on accuracy. In this paper, we propose a general framework called FramNN, which adjusts DNN training model to make it appropriate for underlying hardware. To accelerate training FramNN applies adaptive approximation which dynamically changes the level of hardware approximation depending on the DNN error rate. We test the efficiency of the proposed design over six popular DNN applications.

However, the software defined networking (SDN) architecture offers no clue to the design of micro DCs (MDCs) for meeting complex and stringent requirements from next generation 5G networks. This is because canonical SDN lacks a clear distinction between functional network parts, such as core and edge elements. Besides, there is no decoupling between the routing and the network policy. In this paper, we introduce residue defined networking architecture (RDNA) as a new approach for enabling key features like ultra-reliable and low-latency communication in MDC networks. RDNA explores the programmability of residues number system as a fundamental concept to define a minimalist forwarding model for core nodes. Instead of forwarding packets based on classical table lookup operations, core nodes are tableless switches that forward packets using merely remainder of the division (modulo) operations. By solving a residue congruence system representing a network topology, we found out the algorithms and their mathematical properties to design RDNA‚Äôs routing system that: 1) supports unicast and multicast communication; 2) provides resilient routes with protection for the entire route; and 3) is scalable for 2-tier Clos topologies.

We first consider a special case of ON-OFF channels plus constant-bit-rate videos and establish a scheduling policy that achieves every point in the capacity region under heavy-traffic conditions. This policy is then extended for more general fading channels and variable-bit-rate videos, and we prove that it remains optimal under some mild conditions.

To accelerate inference, CANNA's layer-based approximation approach selectively relaxes the computation in each layer of neural network, as a function its sensitivity to approximation.

Real-life testbeds are built consisting of 10 UAVs and 20 robotic cars that produce background traffic. LoRa, WiFi and LTE networks are employed to provide broadband and cellular wireless network support.

Data reuse is a hardware-efficient way to improve data access throughput by exploiting locality in memory access patterns. We found that for many applications in image and video processing, a global data reuse scheme can be shared by multiple patterns. In this paper, we propose an efficient data reuse strategy for multi-pattern data access. Firstly, a heuristic algorithm is proposed to extract the reuse information as well as find the non-reusable data elements of each pattern. Then the non-reusable elements are partitioned into several memory banks by an efficient memory partitioning algorithm. Moreover, the reuse information is utilized to generate the global data reuse logic shared by the multi-pattern. We design a novel algorithm to minimize the number of registers required by the data reuse logic. Experimental results show that compared with the state-of-the-art approach, our proposed method can reduce the number of required BRAMs by 62.2% on average, with the average reduction of 82.1% in SLICE, 87.1% in LUTs, 71.6% in Flip-Flops, 73.1% in DSP48Es, 83.8% in SRLs, 46.7% in storage overhead, 79.1% in dynamic power consumption, and 82.6% in execution time of memory partitioning.

The challenge of using SRAM PUF-based key generation on FP-GAs is that high-capacity NVM, such as Flash, is not available on chip. Only expensive one-time-programmable (OTP) memory with limited capacity, such as e-fuses, can be utilized to store helper data. Our work allows a significant reduction of helper data size (HDS) through two innovative techniques. The first uses biterror-rate (BER)-aware lossy compression: by treating a fraction of reliable bits as unreliable, it effectively reduces the size of the reliability mask. Considering practical costs of error characterization, the second technique permits across-temperature HDS minimization strategies based on bit-selection (with or without subsequent compression) using room-temperature only characterization. The method is based on stochastic concentration theory and allows efficiently forming confidence intervals for true worst-case BER. We use it to enable lossy compression and key reconstruction with success arbitrarily close to certainty. Results show that compared to maskless alternative, the proposed algorithm achieves an up to 4.5X HDS reduction with only 60% raw bits. Compared to lossless compression, we achieve a further 25% total HDS reduction, at the cost of doubling the number of raw PUF bits, for a 128-bit key.

DeepPicar uses the same network architecture-9 layers, 27 million connections and 250K parameters-and can drive itself in real-time using a web camera and a Raspberry Pi 3 quad-core platform. Using DeepPicar, we analyze the Pi 3's computing capabilities to support end-to-end deep learning based real-time control of autonomous vehicles. We also systematically compare other contemporary embedded computing platforms using the DeepPicar's CNN-based real-time control workload. We find that all tested platforms, including the Pi 3, are capable of supporting the CNN-based real-time control, from 20 Hz up to 100 Hz, depending on hardware platform. However, we find that shared resource contention remains an important issue that must be considered in applying CNN models on shared memory based embedded computing platforms; we observe up to 11.6X execution time increase in the CNN based control loop due to shared resource contention. To protect the CNN workload, we also evaluate state-of-the-art cache partitioning and memory bandwidth throttling techniques on the Pi 3. We find that cache partitioning is ineffective, while memory bandwidth throttling is an effective solution.",2325-1301;2325-1271,978-1-5386-7759-9978-1-5386-7760,10.1109/RTCSA.2018.00011,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8607229,"Real-time, Autonomous car, Convolutional neural network, Case study",Real-time systems;Neural networks;Automobiles;Cameras;Hardware;Autonomous automobiles;Autonomous vehicles,automobiles;convolutional neural nets;embedded systems;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;neural net architecture;neurocontrollers,DeepPicar;CNN-based real-time control workload;real self-driving car;hardware platform;contemporary embedded computing platforms;autonomous vehicles;end-to-end deep learning;Raspberry Pi 3 quad-core platform;network architecture-9 layers;car steering angles;deep convolutional neural network;DAVE-2;autonomous car platform;low-cost deep neural network-based autonomous car;CNN workload;CNN based control loop,,,33,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

It is not only a memory intensive operation but also a compute intensive process. The previous efforts to improve the performance of 2-D convolution have primarily focused on the memory access challenges. However, the convolver's performance is highly dependent on the efficient design of the computation units, which can be enhanced significantly by employing some techniques such as pipelining. In this brief, a pipelined with low pixel access rate architecture for implementation of 2-D convolution is presented. Compared to the conventional convolvers, the proposed design involves a fixed (independent to the problem/kernel) size, and a significantly shorter critical path specifically for large kernel sizes where the proposed convolver works with 283-MHz clock frequency, on a Xilinx Virtex-7 (XC7V2000t) field-programmable gate array, for a 3 √ó 3 kernel. Additionally, the required pixel access rate of the new scheme is less than that of the state-of-the-art methods, which is only 849 Mb/s for a 3 √ó 3 kernel and 8-bit pixels.

Hardware implementation of corner detection algorithms, such as the Harris corner detector (HCD) has become a viable solution for meeting real-time requirements of the applications. A major challenge lies in the design of power, energy and area efficient architectures that can be deployed in tightly constrained embedded systems while still meeting real-time requirements. In this paper, we proposed a bit-width optimization strategy for designing hardware-efficient HCD that exploits the thresholding step in the algorithm to determine interest points from the corner responses. The proposed strategy relies on the threshold as a guide to truncate the bit-widths of the operators at various stages of the HCD pipeline with only marginal loss of accuracy. Synthesis results based on 65-nm CMOS technology show that the proposed strategy leads to power-delay reduction of 35.2%, and area reduction of 35.4% over the baseline implementation. In addition, through careful retiming, the proposed implementation achieves over 2.2 times increase in maximum frequency while achieving an area reduction of 35.1% and power-delay reduction of 35.7% over the baseline implementation. Finally, we performed repeatability tests to show that the optimized HCD architecture achieves comparable accuracy with the baseline implementation (average decrease of repeatability is less than 0.6%).",1051-8215;1558-2205,,10.1109/TCSVT.2017.2757998,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8053835,Corner detection;hardware acceleration;VLSI;embedded vision,Edge detection;Computer architecture;Optimization;Detectors;Computer vision;Real-time systems;Pipeline processing;VLSI,CMOS integrated circuits;computer vision;edge detection;embedded systems;feature extraction;field programmable gate arrays;image matching;logic design;object recognition;stereo image processing,baseline implementation;optimized HCD architecture;power-delay reduction;65-nm CMOS technology;HCD pipeline;hardware-efficient HCD;bit-width optimization strategy;tightly constrained embedded systems;area efficient architectures;real-time requirements;corner detection algorithms;hardware implementation;stereo matching;motion analysis;object recognition;high-speed corner detection;Harris corner detector architecture,,2,44,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines

Thus, finding a close-to-optimal solution consists of exploring the design space by appropriate heuristics identifying those design points that maximize or minimize the desired (multiple) objective functions subject to a set of constraints. In general, exploring the design space efficiently is a challenging task due to the massive number of admissible design points.

Most of these leaked emanations originate from logical processes of the IPE itself. Hence by capturing these emanations, sensitive information can be passively obtained without needing physical access to the device. In this research paper, a method is proposed in which the eavesdropping system reconstructs the target display without any prior-knowledge of the system itself. This is realized by retrieving the synchronization information of the IPE using auto-correlation techniques.

Furthermore, an effective objectness measure is proposed with intuitive geometrical interpretation to extract some reliable object and background regions, which provided as the basis to define the foreground potential, background potential, and the constraint to support saliency propagation. These potentials and the constraint are formulated into the proposed SCOM framework to generate an optimal saliency map for each frame in a video.

However, generating and receiving PAM-4 at line rates of 112 Gb/s has proven challenging, without relying on power-hungry tools as digital signal processing and digital-to-analog converters, as it requires linearity from the E/O-components in the link and/or predistortion techniques. Moving the binary to multilevel conversion to the optical domain would greatly relax these requirements. Electroabsorption-based transceivers would be ideally suited for this type of data center interconnects as they are capable of combining low-power and high bandwidth operation with a very compact layout, removing the need for large travelling wave structures and dedicated 50 Œ© terminations. In this paper, we present a novel transmitter topology for generating PAM-4 using two binary-driven electroabsorption modulators in parallel.

This paper presents a parallel steering control framework for an intelligent vehicle using moving horizon optimization. The framework considers lateral stability, collision avoidance and actuator saturation and describes them as constraints, which can blend the operation of a human driver and a parallel steering controller effectively. Moreover, the road hazard and the steering operation error are employed to evaluate the operational hazardous of an intelligent vehicle. Under the hazard evaluation, the intelligent vehicle will be mainly operated by the human driver when the vehicle operates in a safe and stable manner. The automated steering driving objective will play an active role and regulate the steering operations of the intelligent vehicle based on the hazard evaluation.

However, this important performance is achieved by increasing the encoder computational complexity. That's why HEVC complexity is a crucial subject. The most time consuming and the most intensive computing part of HEVC is the motion estimation based principally on the sum of absolute differences (SAD) or the sum of square differences (SSD) algorithms. For these reasons, the authors proposed an implementation of these algorithms on a low cost NVIDIA GPU (graphics processing unit) using the Fermi architecture developed with Compute Unified Device Architecture language. The proposed algorithm is based on the parallel-difference and the parallel-reduction process. The investigational results show a significant speed-up in terms of execution time for most 64 √ó 64 pixel blocks. In fact, the proposed parallel algorithm permits a significant reduction in the execution time that reaches up to 56.17 and 30.4%, compared to the CPU, for SAD and SSD algorithms, respectively. This improvement proves that parallelising the algorithm with the new proposed reduction process for the Fermi-GPU generation leads to better results. These findings are based on a static study that determines the PU percentage utilisation for each dimension in the HEVC. This study shows that the larger PUs are the most utilised in temporal levels 3 and 4, which attain 84.56% for class E.

An omnidirectional mobile robot is a type of holonomic robots. It can move simultaneously and independently in translation and rotation. The RoboCup small-size league, a robotic soccer competition, is chosen as the research platform in this paper. The first part of this research is to design and implement an embedded system that can communicate with a remote server using a wireless link, and execute received commands. Second, a fuzzy-tuned proportional-integral (PI) path planner and a related low-level controller are proposed to attain optimal input for driving a linear discrete dynamic model of the omnidirectional mobile robot. To fit the planning requirements and avoid slippage, velocity, and acceleration filters are also employed. In particular, low-level optimal controllers, such as a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) for multiple-input-multiple-output acceleration and deceleration of velocity are investigated, where an LQR controller is running on the robot with feedback from motor encoders or sensors. Simultaneously, a fuzzy adaptive PI is used as a highlevel controller for position monitoring, where an appropriate vision system is used as a source of position feedback. A key contribution presented in this research is an improvement in the combined fuzzy-PI LQR controller over a traditional PI controller. Moreover, the efficiency of the proposed approach and PI controller are also discussed. Simulation and experimental evaluations are conducted with and without external disturbance.

A Simplified PWM Strategy for Three-Level Converters on Three-Phase Four-Wire Active Power Filter,F. Li; F. He; Z. Ye; T. Fernando; X. Wang; X.

The conventional three-dimensional space vector pulse width modulation (3-D-SVPWM) strategy is adopted as a normal solution to the problem, but the selection of space vector sectors for four-wire converter is both abstract and complicated in practice. This paper proposes a new PWM strategy accordingly to simplify the selection process and the calculation of duration. Compared to the conventional 3D-SVPWM, the proposed method locates the sector of optimal vector directly with the polarity of three-phase reference voltage. Then, by applying voltage-second balance rule, it can perform a fast calculation of the duration and generate PWM signals to control the switching devices' on/off. As an approach to correct the imbalance dc-link capacitor voltage, this strategy reconstructs the switching sequence. A portion of state O duration is disassembled into states P and N to suppress the neutral-point potential offset. The proposed strategy is validated with a range of experiments. The results indicate that this simplified PWM strategy can effectively reduce the computational burden, and also the dc-link capacitor voltage is well controlled.",0885-8993;1941-0107,,10.1109/TPEL.2017.2715498,National Key Research and Development Program; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province of China; University Natural Science Research Project of Jiangsu Province; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7948754,Active power filter (APF);neutral-point potential balance;pulse width modulation (PWM);three-level converter;three phase four wire,Active filters;Electric potential;Switches;Voltage control;Capacitors;Space vector pulse width modulation,active filters;power filters;pulse width modulation;PWM power convertors;switching convertors,imbalance dc-link capacitor voltage;PWM signals;voltage-second balance rule;three-phase reference voltage;optimal vector;3D-SVPWM;four-wire converter;space vector sectors;3-D-SVPWM;three-dimensional space vector pulse width modulation;neutral-point potential;four-wire active power filter;three-level converters;simplified PWM strategy,,1,26,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines

Recuperation of braking energy in drives with vertical transport of load, as well as during the speed reduction within high inertia drives present the most decisive factors for active rectifiers application. The power factor to the grid is approximately equal to unit, but can be adjusted differently if necessary to dynamically compensate for the reactive power of other consumers connected to the same bus as drive with active rectifier. This is only possible if there is an adequate reserve in the power of the inverter. One of the major issues concerning the active rectifier is its operation under distorted grid voltages, due to harmonics or unbalances, which inflict large low-order harmonics in the output voltage and input currents. Although listed advantages make an active rectifier the best choice for high performance electrical drives, the mitigation of low order harmonics in grid currents under different kinds of distortions and unbalances is still a problem analyzed in research community, as well as in the paper.",,978-1-5386-5517-7978-1-5386-5518,10.1109/EFEA.2018.8617093,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8617093,harmonics mitigation;active rectifier;electrical drives;phase-locked loop;control,Rectifiers;Induction motors;Harmonic analysis;Voltage control;Energy efficiency;Reactive power;Harmonic distortion,electric current control;electric drives;invertors;power factor;power grids;rectifiers;rectifying circuits,distorted utility grid;energy efficiency;high inertia drives;active rectifiers application;power factor;reactive power;distorted grid voltages;low-order harmonics;high performance electrical drives;low order harmonics;grid currents;active rectifiers;braking energy;vertical transport;speed reduction;inverter,,,14,,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
