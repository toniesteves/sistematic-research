A 95pJ/label Wide-Range Depth-Estimation Processor for Full-HD Light-Field Applications on FPGA,"High-resolution and wide-range depth maps are the key to enable novel light-field applications, such as digital refocusing, view synthesis, and 3D reconstruction. In this paper, we present an energy-efficient depth-estimation processor on FPGA to meet this purpose. There are two major contributions. First, image-guided depth inference and upsampling is adopted and implemented to provide accurate depth maps while lowering the working frequency from 215MHz to 54MHz. Second, octave search range sampling is proposed to efficiently allocate depth labels for wide-depth-range scenes to save computation and maintain accuracy. Finally, the implementation result on Xilinx ZC706 shows ASIC-comparable energy efficiency-95pJ/label-for Full-HD five-view light fields at 30fps.",2018,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8579289,11
A Reconfigurable Fractional Interpolation Hardware for VVC Motion Compensation,"Fractional interpolation is one of the most computationally complex parts of video compression standards. Fractional interpolation in Versatile Video Coding (VVC) standard has much higher computational complexity than fractional interpolation in previous video compression standards. In this paper, a reconfigurable VVC fractional interpolation hardware for motion compensation is designed and implemented using Verilog HDL. The proposed hardware is the first VVC fractional interpolation hardware for motion compensation in the literature. It interpolates necessary fractional pixels for 1/16 pixel accuracy for all prediction unit sizes. The proposed VVC fractional interpolation hardware, in the worst case, can process 66 quad full HD (3840×2160) frames per second. It has up to 77% less power consumption than baseline VVC fractional interpolation hardware.",2018,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8491801,8
A Low Power Versatile Video Coding (VVC) Fractional Interpolation Hardware,"Fractional interpolation in Versatile Video Coding (VVC) standard has much higher computational complexity than fractional interpolation in previous video compression standards. In this paper, a low power VVC fractional interpolation hardware is designed and implemented using Verilog HDL. The proposed hardware is the first VVC fractional interpolation hardware in the literature. It interpolates necessary fractional pixels for 1/16 pixel accuracy for all prediction unit sizes. The proposed VVC fractional interpolation hardware, in the worst case, can process 40 full HD (1920×1080) frames per second. It has up to 17% less power consumption than original VVC fractional interpolation hardware.",2018,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8597040,10
