Real-time HDTV to 4K and 8K-UHD conversions using anti-aliasing based super resolution algorithm on FPGA,"The demand for light-weight and high-speed super resolution (SR) techniques are growing because of super high-resolution displays, such as 4K/8K ultra high definition televisions (UHDTVs), which have become common. We propose a single pass over up-sampled anti-aliasing based SR method. Our method can attenuate jaggies and perform natural-looking contrast improvement focusing only on the shadow part in the edge of an enlarged image without the need to preserve the entire enlarged image. Therefore, this method is suitable for hardware implementation, and the proposed architecture requires five-line buffers only (in the memory section). We implemented the proposed method on a field programmable gate array (FPGA) and demonstrated HDTV-to-4K and-8K SR processing in real time (60 frames per second).",9,2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0141933117303101
System-on-a-chip (SoC)-based hardware acceleration for foreground and background identification,"The rapid growth of embedded vision applications and accessibility in recent years has instigated a philosophical shift in algorithm and implementation design for artificial intelligence. With the popularization of high-definition video, the amount of data available to be processed has also increased substantially, posing massive computational and communication demands. Hardware acceleration through specialization has received renewed interest in recent years; such acceleration has generally been implemented using two chips, with the image signal processing (ISP) part being performed by a DSP, a GPU or an FPGA and the video content analytics (VCA) part being executed by a processor. GPUs consume a substantial amount of power; thus, it is challenging to deploy them in embedded environments. However, the new generation of SoC-FPGAs that are fabricated with both the microprocessor and FPGA on a single chip consumes less power and can be built into small systems, thereby offering an attractive platform for embedded applications. This study presents the hardware acceleration of a real-time adaptive background and foreground identification algorithm in a SoC, including the capture, processing and display stages. The algorithm can be performed in either 2D or 3D space. The proposed platform uses photometric invariant color, depth data and local binary patterns (LBPs) to distinguish background from foreground. The system uses minimal cell resources, an elastically pipelined architecture is used to absorb variations in processing time, and each pipeline stage is optimized to use the available FPGA primitives. Additionally, the communication-centric architecture used in this work simplifies the implementation of embedded vision algorithms.",3,2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016003217303666
Fast adaptive motion estimation algorithm and its efficient VLSI system for high definition videos,"Motion estimation (ME) plays an important part in the functioning of the video codec by identifying and reducing the temporal redundancies in between successive frames of a video sequence. Block matching algorithm (BMA) has been accepted as one of the finest approaches for motion estimation due to its efficiency and ease of implementation. This paper presents a new and improved iterative and adaptive search strategy for block-based motion estimation along with its efficient hardware implementation. Since it is expected that there will be more demand for streaming video services on mobile devices, designing fine tuning algorithm with dedicated efficient hardware would provide significant benefits. The present motion estimation algorithm is adaptive in nature that takes into consideration the motion content of the current frame while predicting the motion vector. The adaptive nature of the search eases the complexity of motion estimation and the algorithm makes use of the correlation present among the motion vectors of the neighboring blocks to lower the number of search position. Traditionally, such adaptive algorithms are executed by CPU cores running a software stack. Since software involves a significant amount of overheads like fetching into cache, branches, stalls etc., the efficiency of the proposed algorithm can be overshadowed by the hardware platform. To avoid this, compact hardware architecture was developed which stands ahead of other existing architectures as shown in comparison. The VLSI design for the proposed algorithm presented in this work deals with the generation of the adaptive search pattern and use of interleaved memory organization fasten the operational speed. A profitable data re-use scheme and involvement of minimum processing elements required for parallelization reduce the on-chip area. Working at a frequency of 243 MHz, the proposed design can process 66 720p HD (1280 × 720) frames in one second consuming an area of 38.2 K gate equivalent. Hence, the proposed design can be incorporated in video codecs to be used in commercial devices like camcorders, smart phones and other portable, battery-powered video consumer devices. The proposed research method achieves significantly improved results both in terms of algorithmic metrics (PSNR) as well hardware performance (speed, area).",2,2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095741741830099X
A Survey Of mobile face biometrics,"Face biometrics have attracted significant attention as a technology for secure access to mobile devices. This is because almost all smartphones have RGB cameras suitable for capturing faces, and the required user interaction is acceptable given the popularity of ‘selfies’. Most of the traditional methods for face biometrics may not be amenable to native execution on mobile hardware due to their limited memory and computing power. Consequently, a number of algorithms specifically designed or adapted to the mobile environment have been proposed for face biometrics. However, the state-of-the- art related to face biometrics in a mobile environment is not well known. This paper thoroughly and critically surveys face biometrics in terms of face detection and normalization, recognition, and anti-spoofing methods proposed for mobile devices. The overall aim is to improve understanding and discuss the advantages and limitations of the existing methods. Further, challenges and future research directions are identified for further research and development.",8,2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004579061730650X
Online stereo camera calibration for automotive vision based on HW-accelerated A-KAZE-feature extraction,"Nowadays ongoing integration of camera based advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) in vehicles demands increasingly complex digital image processing in order to interpret the surrounding situations. To ensure a timely reaction for obstacles lying ahead, far reaching depth information of the observed scene is necessary. Using stereo camera systems, this is achievable by enlarging the camera base line. With rapid driving, the exact alignment of the stereo images is no longer ensured due to vibrations of the vehicle. Based on detection, extraction and matching of Accelerated-KAZE image features (A-KAZE), the geometric distortions are compensable by estimating the external camera parameters for image rectification. The indispensable frame rate for applications in vehicles and the limited power budget in combination with the SW-flexibility demanded for future ADAS applications requires the usage of optimized hardware architectures. Thus, an online camera calibration based on an HW-accelerated A-KAZE extraction is introduced in this work. The suitability of A-KAZE features for an online camera calibration is proven. Furthermore, the Tensilica Vision P5-processor is evaluated regarding its suitability for real-time A-KAZE feature extraction. This processor provides a comprehensive instruction-set extension for high-performance digital image processing. While preserving the initial A-KAZE accuracy, a feature descriptor length reduction of factor  × 3.8 is attained compared to the initial descriptor size and an estimated frame rate of 20 fps is achieved for A-KAZE feature extraction on the Tensilica Vision P5-processor.",11,2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1383762118304740
A novel GPU-aware Histogram-based algorithm for supporting moving object segmentation in big-data-based IoT application scenarios,"Multimedia data are a popular case of Big Data that expose the classical 3V characteristics (i.e., volume, velocity and variety). Such kind of data are likely to be processed within the core layer of Internet of Things (IoT) platforms, where a multiple, typically high, number of “things” (e.g., sensors, devices, actuators, and so forth) collaborate to massively process big data for supporting intelligent algorithms running over them. In such platforms, the computational bottleneck is very often represented by the component running the main algorithm, while communication and cooperation costs still remain relevant. Inspired by this emerging trend of big-data-based IoT applications, in this paper we focus on the specific application context represented by the problem of supporting moving object segmentation over images originated in the context of big multimedia data, and we propose an innovative background maintenance approach to this end. In particular, we provide a novel GPU-aware Histogram-based Moving Object Segmentation algorithm that adopts a pixel-oriented approach and it is based on Graphic Processing Units (GPU), called pixHMOS_gpu. pixHMOS_gpu allows us to achieve higher performance, hence making the computational gap of big-data-based IoT applications decisively smaller. Experimental results clearly confirm our arguments.",3,2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020025519302269
Block unshifting high-accuracy motion estimation: A new method adapted to super-resolution enhancement,"Sub-pixel motion estimation plays a vital role in a multitude of video applications, including encoding, audiovisual archiving/heritage and super-resolution enhancement. Most existing block-based methods rely on the implicit assumption that blocks can be accurately predicted through appropriate shifts. In particular, shifted blocks in the target frame are estimated from the associated anchor frame blocks. The present paper introduces a different strategy, which discards this assumption and treats anchor and target frame blocks equally, as sub-pixel shifted versions of an unavailable implied block. The new method attempts to construct this implied block and, by calculating the “imaginary” motion vectors that relate it to the two existing blocks, it estimates the wanted motion vectors more accurately. This approach aims at extracting motion vectors that more accurately represent the actual movements of objects, minimizing the interpolation error that is associated with sub-pixel shifting, which manifests as blurring and a lowering of contrast. The new method focuses on accurate motion estimation, paying less attention to the associated computational load. Hence, the approach is both inspired from, and proposed for, super-resolution enhancement scenarios, where higher definition motion image sequences are estimated from their available lower definition counterparts. In order to implement the new strategy, an algorithm for reversing the bilinear sub-pixel shift of a block (unshifting) is implemented and validated. Comparisons between original blocks of images and blocks that have been shifted and unshifted back to their original coordinates showcase the accuracy of the unshifting process. The proposed motion estimation method is evaluated through a number of different experimental assessment procedures and metrics, comparing it to existing high-accuracy state-of-the-art motion estimation methods.",7,2018,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S092359651830273X
Signal processing challenges for digital holographic video display systems,"Holography is considered to be the ultimate display technology since it can account for all human visual cues such as stereopsis and eye focusing. Aside from hardware constraints for building holographic displays, there are still many research challenges regarding holographic signal processing that need to be tackled. In this overview, we delineate the steps needed to realize an end-to-end chain from digital content acquisition to display, involving the efficient generation, representation, coding and quality assessment of digital holograms. We discuss the current state-of-the-art and what hurdles remain to be taken to pave the way towards realistic visualization of dynamic holographic content.",2,2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0923596518304855
